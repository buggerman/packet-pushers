## Tribute

This game is a love letter to the original Dope Wars by Beermat Software, which introduced countless players to the addictive world of virtual entrepreneurship in the 1990s shareware scene. While the mechanics have been updated for modern browsers, the spirit of risk, reward, and absurdist humor remains unchanged.

*"Some games teach you about economics. Others teach you about life. Dope Wars taught us about both."*
