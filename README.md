## The Rubber Chicken Meta

True veterans know: the most feared weapon in the underworld isn't a gun—it's complete unpredictability. The Rubber Chicken represents the ultimate psychological warfare tool, striking fear into the hearts of cops and criminals alike through sheer absurdity.

*"In the criminal underworld, nothing is more terrifying than someone who has completely lost touch with reality."*

## 🎖️ Tribute

This game is a love letter to the original Dope Wars by Beermat Software, which introduced countless players to the addictive world of virtual entrepreneurship in the 1990s shareware scene. While the mechanics have been updated for modern browsers, the spirit of risk, reward, and absurdist humor remains unchanged.

*"Some games teach you about economics. Others teach you about life. Dope Wars taught us about both."*
